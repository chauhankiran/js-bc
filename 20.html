    <h1>Switch</h1>

    <p>
      You can write the previous condition code in <code>switch</code> as follows:
    </p>

    <pre>let day = 0

<mark>switch</mark> (day) <mark>{</mark>
  case 0:
    // It's Monday.
    break;
  case 1:
    // It's Tuesday.
    break;
  case 2:
    // It's Wednesday.
    break;
  case 3:
    // It's Thursday.
    break;
  case 4:
    // It's Friday.
    break;
<mark>}</mark></pre>

    <p>
      I'm not going into the details of <code>break</code>, <code>default</code> and how the execution flows. I assume that you already know this or you can read online as these concepts are too easy to understand by write few example code.
