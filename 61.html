    <h1>Extension Doesn't Matter</h1>

    <p>
      The interesting thing about Node is that it assume that if you are running some file against <code>node</code>, file should have valid JavaScript code. Due to this extension doesn't matter. Change the extension from <code>.js</code> to <code>.something</code> and then run.
    </p>

    <pre>$ node hello.something
hello, world</pre>

    <p>
      The disadvantage of this is, you'll not get syntax highlighting and some default support from modern text-editor if <code>.js</code> extension is not found.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand as it assume that the file should be a valid JavaScript, if you have <code>.js</code> extension you can leave off the extension.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's change the extension back to <code>.js</code> from <code>.something</code> and then run without extension:
    </p>

    <pre>$ node hello
hello, world</pre>

    <p>
      Things are not ends here! Let's create a new folder <code>greeting</code>. Rename the <code>hello.js</code> file to <code>index.js</code> and then move this file into <code>greeting</code> folder. Now, if you run the following command it will execute <code>greeting/index.js</code> file:
    </p>

    <pre>$ node greeting
hello, world</pre>

    <p>
      When node found that greeting is a folder and no file name is mentioned, it'll automatically run <code>index.js</code>.
    </p>
