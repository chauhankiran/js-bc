    <h1>Obvious Question</h1>

    <p>
      Now you might have question like which one we need to follow? My personal suggestion is:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Always give <code>.js</code> extension to your file.</li>
      <li>Run the file with extension even though it is options</li>
      <li>Use folder and <code>index.js</code> based on requirement and environment you are working.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The reason why I mentioned all these because you'll see all these (except first one, which is rare but still used in some old project) used many different places.
    </p>
