    <h1>Array Destructuring</h1>

    <p>
      Instead of creating separate variable and assigning value to each just write -
    </p>

    <pre>let [maths, physics, chemistry] = marks</pre>

    <p>
      JavaScript automatically assign first element of marks to <code>maths</code>, second element of marks to <code>physics</code>, and third element of marks to <code>chemistry</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      What if I don't want <code>physics</code> marks. Just leave the space off -
    </p>

    <pre>let [maths, , chemistry] = marks</pre>

    <p>
      What if I only want chemistry marks. Just leave that you don't want -
    </p>

    <pre>let [, , chemistry] = marks</pre>

    <p>
      Regarding above syntax, don't do this - this is not readable. You need to count comma, and the element to know what chemistry will get from array. In this case, I would suggest you to go with old way.
    </p>
