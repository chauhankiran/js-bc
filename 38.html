    <h1>Questions?</h1>

    <p>
      This complete the sub-session on JavaScript. In this sub-session, I wrote very little code to demonstrate the examples because I assume the JavaScript familiarity. Now, we're going to do QA. Please ask question(s), if you have. After this QA, I'll give you 20 minutes to practice some of the concepts which you like to revise. After 20 minutes, we'll continue with JavaScript but this time with ES6 sub-session.
