    <h1>Why JavaScript?</h1>

    <p>
      <em>the</em> Bootcamp is oriented around the JavaScript. I would like to take a few minutes to explain why. I personally do not have a soft corner for JavaScript language (I have a soft corner for Ruby and C). On the other hand, it is also true that I'll spend as much time as possible after JavaScript. I hate to say that but JavaScript rules the world now.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since its invention, JavaScript was and is the programming language of the webpage and it likely remains the only programming language on the webpage. After <a href="https://tinyclouds.org/">Rayn Dahl</a>'s effort, due to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a>, JavaScript now runs on the server side also. In this way, JavaScript is the only language that runs on both front and back end sides. None of any other language has such a capability.

      Let's talk about mobile. There are two popular mobile platforms - iPhone and Android. To build an iPhone application or app, you need to use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a> or Objective-C. To build an Android app, you need to use Java or Kotlin or Dart. Did I mention JavaScript? You can build a mobile app using JavaScript. Not just that but you can build a mobile app for both iPhone and Android using single JavaScript codebase. In other words, with the knowledge of JavaScript, your reach increase in the mobile domain also apart from the web.

      Let's talk about desktop applications or apps. You have a great choice of programming languages to build desktop apps. You can use C, C#, Java, Python, Go, Ruby, and many other programming languages to build apps. Did I mention JavaScript? You can <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">build</a> <a href="https://tauri.studio/">desktop</a> apps using JavaScript. Not just that but you can also build desktop apps for Windows, Mac, and GNU/Linux from a single codebase. In other words, with the knowledge of JavaScript, your reach increase in the desktop domain as well apart from web and mobile.

    <p>
      Things do not end here, the front end of the GNU/Linux operating system or a graphical user interface that you get with most of the distribution is also written in JavaScript. Yes, I'm talking about <a href="https://www.gnome.org/gnome-3/">GNOME</a>. If you are using GNU/Linux, the chances are high that you are running GNOME, which is again written in JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even there's an effort on an making operating system using JavaScript. I haven't talked about DSL or little languages. JSON while passing data from one entity to another rules even though there is XML standard.
