    <h1>How to Define Condition?</h1>

    <p>
      Using <code>if</code> keyword such as:
    </p>

    <pre>let day = 0

<mark>if</mark> (day == 0) {
  // It's Monday.
}</pre>

    <p>
      <code>if</code> has <code>else</code>, partner in crime.
    </p>

    <pre>let day = 1

if (day == 0) {
  // It's Monday.
} <mark>else</mark> {
  // It's Tuesday.
}</pre>

    <p>
      <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> might need as many as <code>else if</code> they want when they're in trouble such as:
    </p>

    <pre>let day = 0

if (day == 0) {
  // It's Monday.
} <mark>else if</mark> (day == 1) {
  // It's Tuesday.
} <mark>else if</mark> (day == 2) {
  // It's Wednesday.
} <mark>else if</mark> (day == 3) {
  // It's Thursday.
} <mark>else if</mark> (day == 4) {
  // It's Friday.
}</pre>

    <p>
      If the number of <code>else if</code> in your condition is greater than two, it is suggested to use other way. Do you know other way to write condition?
