    <h1>Array Destructuring with Spread Syntax</h1>

    <p>
      Consider the following example:
    </p>

    <pre>let marks = [34, 35, 37, 45, 40, 56]</pre>

    <p>
      These are the marks of seven subject. I'm interested in first, second and then remaining. In other words, I want to store 34 in one variable, 35 in second variable and remaining element in third variable as array.
    </p>

    <p>
      With destructuring and spread operator, it is trivial:
    </p>

    <pre>let [math, physics, ...other_marks] = marks</pre>

    <p>
      With this, math variable hold 34, physics variable hold 35, and other_marks - an array variable hold remaining marks - [37, 45, 40, 56]
    </p>

    <p>
      Destructuring and spread operators used a lot in React.
    </p>
