    <h1>Suggestion</h1>

    <p>
      Although it is highly recommended that we should use same name as string id while doing <code>require</code> it is not compulsory. You can write following and it just work fine:
    </p>

    <pre>const something_important = require('os')

something_important.type()</pre>

    <p>
      But, this program is not readable. Assume that somebody written 200 lines of code and somewhere around 145 line, you find <code>important_stuff_from_linux</code> object, how do you know what it is? Instead if <code>os</code> is written, you might get rough idea on that it is the <code>os</code> module from Node.
