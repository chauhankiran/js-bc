    <h1>Syntactical Sugar</h1>

    <p>
      In order to iterate through an array, we now have three possible solutions. As we moved from <code>for</code> to <code>.forEach()</code> to <code>for...of</code> readability of code increase.
    </p>


    <p>
      These three options are there for you to just ease of programming. This is what we called <em>syntactical sugar</em> on syntax to make syntax or code looks "sweet". At the end, behind the scene same basic operation is running at bottom level of JavaScript but with this sugar added syntax, it now look nicer.
