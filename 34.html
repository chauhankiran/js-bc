    <h1>Syntactical Sugar</h1>

    <p>
      In order to iterate through an array, we have three possible ways. As we moved from <code>for</code> to <code>.forEach()</code> to <code>for...of</code> readiness of code increase. This is what we called <em>syntactical sugar</em> on syntax to make syntax or code looks "sweet". At the end, behind the scene same basic operation is running at bottom level of JavaScript but with this sugar added syntax, it now look nicer.
