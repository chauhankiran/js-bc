    <h1>An Interactive Environment</h1>

    <p>
      Remember, the console from where you type JavaScript and execute instantly? You have the same interactive environment in Node. Just type <code>node</code> in terminal as follows:
    </p>

    <pre>$ node
Welcome to Node.js v14.3.0.
Type ".help" for more information.
></pre>

    <p>
      Now you can type the JavaScript and it'll going to execute after pressing Enter. For example,
    </p>

    <pre>> console.log("hello, world")
hello, world
undefined
></pre>

    <p>
      All the JavaScript code we write or see so far in first and second sub-sessions are valid in Node as well. As I mentioned previously, Node is a JavaScript runtime with more or less functionalities.
    </p>

    <p>
      FYI: You can exit the environment using <code>.exit</code> command.
