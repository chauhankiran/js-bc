    <h1>Node</h1>

    <p>
      In 2009, Rayn Dahl copy the code if this V8 engine and create a standalone software. This software is Node.js or Node. Using this you can run JavaScript on your computer and without web browser (which was impossible previously outside of web browser). Note just this, he added more functionalities that were missing in browser's JavaScript such as access of file system, access of process and many many more as modules or standard libraries.

    <p>
      That's it for the initial introduction. Node is more that these. I mean Node is many thing for many developer based on whom you ask - back-end software, compiler, process, service and many many more.
    </p>

    <p>
      For now, let just go with the understanding that Node is JavaScript runtime environment which run JavaScript outside of browser.
