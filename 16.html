    <h1>How to Define Constant?</h1>

    <p>
      Using <code>const</code> keyword such as:
    </p>

    <pre><mark>const</mark> version = 1.2</pre>

    <p>
      Nowadays, developers initiate the movement of defining all the variables as constant unless they're going to modify in future. I'm not sure, but I think this movement is coming from functional programming camp with technical terms such as mutable or immutable variables. Yeah, they don't use word such as constant.
