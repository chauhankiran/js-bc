    <h1>Flow</h1>

    <p>
      The session names are generic instead of technology-specific such as the first session will be on Node, the second session will be on JavaScript. The reason is, this Bootcamp is learning-oriented rather than technology-oriented. The flow of the Bootcamp will be like a story, goes smoothly towards the conclusion.
