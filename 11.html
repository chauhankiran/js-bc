    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to session one - <span class="name">Introduction</span>. This a short sub-session, where we're going to introduce ourselves in front of other to know each others and then I'll take a few minutes to justify the chosen language of this Bootcamp.
    </p>

    <p>
      As I already mentioned, who am I, it is now your turn to introduce yourself. Please!
    </p>
