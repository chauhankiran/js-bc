    <h1>Projects We're Going to Build</h1>

    <p>
      In terms of project(s), we're going to build one JavaScript project, one front-end project, and one back-end project. Not just these, we're going to build yet another project in JavaScript from existing open source project. Finally, we complete our learning by contributing to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> in some ways.
