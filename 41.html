    <h1>Newer Version of JavaScript</h1>

    <p>
      ES6 is the newer version of JavaScript. ES6 is not the current latest version of JavaScript. The latest version of JavaScript is ES11. But, ES6 was big in terms of update and changes than these after update versions. Because of this, you'll see ES6 on web more than any other version while doing search for JavaScript.
