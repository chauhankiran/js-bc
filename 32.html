    <h1>Suggestions</h1>

    <p>
      Although, I've used nonsensical name of variables to define arrays but you must avoid it while writing in projects or in bigger programs. The recommendation for naming array variable is -
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Name the variable after what it contains. For example, in above case, if the array contains marks out of 50, then we should give the name of array after <code>mark</code> or <code>marks</code>.</li>
      <li>Array name must be plural e.g. <code>marks</code> not </code>mark</code>. In this way, when you loop through it, you get a single element and can assign singular name of your array such as <code>mark</code> of <code>marks</code>.</li>
      <li>Also, while defining an array, put a space after comma in box brackets that make array elements more readable<sup>*</sup>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Putting above suggestion into action our above program becomes:
    </p>

    <pre><mark>marks</mark> = [34, 45, 47, 40, 33]

<mark>marks</mark>.forEach(function(<mark>mark</mark>){
  console.log(mark)
})</pre>

    <p>
      While running a loop on <code>marks</code>, with each iteration, you'll get <code>mark</code>.
    </p>

      <sup>*</sup> Trust me, the readability is so important that <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html#indentation">Linux</a> coding standard enforce you to put 8 spaces of indentation in code because they're reading quite good amount of code everyday. In other words, readability of code is important when you reach at the level where you read more code than actual programming.
