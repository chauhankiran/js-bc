    <h1>pid? How You Know?</h1>

    <p>
      You might have question that how I know about the <code>process</code> and <code>pid</code>? I know about these because it is written on Node's official <a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/">documentation</a> or docs. In this docs, you can find <a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/process.html"><code>process</code></a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/process.html#process_process_pid"><code>pid</code></a>.
