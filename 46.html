    <h1>Strong Interpolation</h1>

    <p>
      Check out this example:
    </p>

    <pre>first_name = "Bruce"
last_name = "Wayne"

console.log("Hello " + first_name + " " + last_name ". How are you?")</pre>

    <p>
      This example print the greeting message using strong concatenation. I don't know about you, but for me its is like normal programming that I miss something from above concatenation - it might be space or + or something else. But, this doesn't work for me at first try!
    </p>

    <p>
      Luckily, ES6 solve this feature with something called String Literals or String Interpolation where you just write a complete string or text you want to print with variable such as:
    </p>

    <pre>first_name = "Bruce"
last_name = "Wayne"

console.log(`Hello ${first_name} ${last_name}. How are you?`)</pre>

    <p>
      While doing string interpolation, you need to use back-tick instead of single or double quote and then wrap your variable within <code>${}</code> to differentiate this from normal text. No more +, calculation of spaces within string concatenation.
