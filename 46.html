    <h1>String Interpolation</h1>

    <p>
      Check out this example:
    </p>

    <pre>first_name = "Bruce"
last_name = "Wayne"

console.log("Hello " + first_name + " " + last_name ". How are you?")</pre>

    <p>
      This example print the greeting message using <span class="name">string concatenation</span>. I don't know about you, but for me its is like normal programming error that I miss something from above concatenation - it might be space or + or something else. But, I couldn't able to write string concatenation at the first try, it always send arrow to me!
    </p>

    <p>
      Luckily, ES6 solved this with something called <span class="name">String Literals</span> or <span class="name">String Interpolation</span> where you just write a complete string or text you want to print including variables such as:
    </p>

    <pre>first_name = "Bruce"
last_name = "Wayne"

console.log(`Hello ${first_name} ${last_name}. How are you?`)</pre>

    <p>
      While doing string interpolation, you need to use <span class="name">back-tick</span> instead of single or double quote and then wrap your variable within <code>${}</code> to differentiate it from normal text. No more + and calculation of spaces within string concatenation.
